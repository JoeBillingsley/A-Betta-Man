Make people look like Cristiano Betta; What more would want?

The initial idea came from a mixture of wanting to use the Microsoft Kinect sdk and the mention of a prize for the best use of Cristiano Betta's face.

This meant that we started out with the idea of using the Kinect's camera to track a person and replace their head/face with Cristiano's. We got this working and then thought to expand this to an android app.

The android app opens a view of the camera and whenever it detects a face in its viewfinder it will replace the persons face with one of Cristiano's. We also implemented the braintree api to allow payments for more of Cristiano's faces to be used.
